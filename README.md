# DMCalc

A minimalistic discrete math calculator. Created by [Victor Szeto](http://victorszeto.com) and [Timothy Tong](http://timothytong.com). Available on the Google Play Store.

## Features
### DivMod
Quickly calculate the quotient and remainder of two numbers. Useful for solving Linear Diophantine Equations by hand or doing the Euclidean Algorithim by hand.
### Linear Diophantine
Given a Linear Diophantine Equation of the form ax + by = c, finds the lowest integers that satisfy x and y, as well as the general formula for integer solutions of x and y in the form x = x<sub>0</sub> ± k<sub>1</sub> \* n<sub>1</sub> and y = y<sub>0</sub> ∓ k<sub>2</sub> \* n<sub>2</sub>.
### Repeated Squaring
Given three integers *b*, *e*, and *m*, calculates the remainder of a number *b* raised to the power *e* modulo *m*. Useful for doing cryptography exercises by hand.
