{"name":"DMCalc","tagline":"Minimalist discrete math calculator for Android.","body":"# DMCalc\r\n\r\nA minimalist discrete math calculator. Available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.victorszeto.dmcalc).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n### DivMod\r\nQuickly calculate the quotient and remainder of two numbers. Useful for solving Linear Diophantine Equations by hand or doing the Euclidean Algorithim by hand.\r\n### Linear Diophantine\r\nGiven a Linear Diophantine Equation of the form ax + by = c, finds the lowest integers that satisfy x and y, as well as the general formula for integer solutions of x and y in the form x = x<sub>0</sub> ± k<sub>1</sub> \\* n<sub>1</sub> and y = y<sub>0</sub> ∓ k<sub>2</sub> \\* n<sub>2</sub>.\r\n### Repeated Squaring\r\nGiven three integers *b*, *e*, and *m*, calculates the remainder of a number *b* raised to the power *e* modulo *m*. Useful for doing cryptography exercises by hand. \r\n\r\n## About\r\nCreated by [Victor Szeto](http://victorszeto.com) and [Timothy Tong](http://timothytong.com).
